If you have been consuming alcohol or narcotic drugs this 2015 Holiday season, are driving a motor vehicle and find yourself being stopped by a police officer, there are several considerations for you to take into account...... 

Unfortuantely, if you are stopped and an officer believes you are DUI, there is no hard and fast answer as to how one should respond as each instance is different. However, there are some guiding principles one should follow: 

1) Be reasonably polite and courteous with the officer. Common decency goes a long way folks! 

2) When the officer is approaching, keep your hands on the steering wheel. Frankly this is as much for your benefit as it is for the officer who is approaching your vehicle. This officer has no idea who you are or if you may try and harm him. The officer will want to see your hands to make sure you are not trying to pull a weapon. 

3) One of the first things an officer will do is to request your license, registration and insurance papers. Produce your license, registration and insurance documentation quickly. Know where these items are. Fumbling around for these items, not knowing where they are - can and will be used against you. Nothing, the prosecutor will argue, says impaired more than your not being able to find these documents. 

4) Next, the officer is likely to ask you if you have been drinking. How do you respond to this question? With this question the officer is soliciting information to use against you. Keep that in mind. If you have not been drinking alcohol, then respond no. However, if you have been drinking, do not discuss the subject of alcohol consumption with the officer. It is perfectly acceptable to indicate to the officer that you would prefer not to answer his question(s). 

5) Next, the officer will likely ask you to step out of your vehicle and walk to the rear of your vehicle or front of his vehicle. Be mindful that most police stops these days are recorded on video cameras mounted to the front of the patrol vehicle's dashboard. The grace, or lack thereof, with which you exit your vehicle and walk will likely be recorderd by the dashboard camera. 

6) The officer may ask you to blow into a hand held device or to take a prelimanry breath test (PBT) while you are standing on the side of the road. This device will measure the presence of alcohol in your breath. You are not required under Georgia law to do so. You may refuse to take this preliminary breath test. 

7) Next, the officer may ask you to perform a series of field sobriety test (FST) or he may just begin to perform these tests on you without asking. These tests include an eye test where the officer shines a light in your eyes (HGN), one legged stand, nine step walk and turn, five finger dexterity test, alphabet recitation and finger to nose with head tilted back. The officer is not going to tell you that you have a choice to not perform these tests. Why won't the officer tell me I do not have to perform these field tests? Again, the officer is attempting to obtain evidence against you in a DUI case. Ask the officer if you are required to perform these field tests. Georgia law does not require one to submit to or perform these field sobriety tests. If you are requested to perform these tests, you are not required by law to do so and may decline the officer's request. If the officer simply begins these tests without asking your consent to these tests, you may stop performing these tests. 

8) When responding to the officer, answer in clear, concise and short statements. Most of these officers are trained in DUI detection. It is best to avoid long answers. If the officer believes you are DUI, you are going to be arrested. It is in your interest to minimize long discussions. 

9) After the officer arrests you, he will likely request you to submit to a state-administered test of your blood, breath or urine. This is the official test which the State will try and use in Court. This test can be the strongest evidence the State has in its prosecution of you. The State of Georgia is an implied consent state, meaning you consent to a chemical test by driving on roads in Georgia. You are not required to take this test and may refuse to do so however there are consequences attached to such a refusal. Your driving privileges can be suspended if you refuse to take the test for up to one year - however you are entitled to a hearing before any such suspension if you act quickly enough to preserve this right to a hearing. Likewise, your driving privileges can be suspended for up to one year as well if you take the test and your alcohol concentration exceeds the legally prescribed limits for your personal circumstances - again, you are entitled to a hearing before any such suspension takes effect if you act quickly enough to preserve this right to a hearing. It is up to you to decide whether you submit to a chemical test. 

Keep in mind these are a few guiding principles for one who is a licensed by the State of Georgia and stopped by a law enforcement officer within the State of Georgia to consider and are in no way to be construed as legal advice for a particular situation. Each individual's circumstances will vary greatly and one must seek specific legal advice from a qualified attorney who practices DUI law.
